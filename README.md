# Song lyrics application

Web application for finding song lyrics. I have used free version of API provided by Musixmatch Developer, only 30% of the lyrics can be displayed. On the main page, 25 most popular songs in Poland are displayed. User can search for and check lyrics of any song included in database. This is non-commercial project based on Traversy Media youtube video. I've expanded it by implementing Redux to manage states in application. I've also made changes in design and functionality.

## Usage


```bash
npm install
npm start
```

## Built with
